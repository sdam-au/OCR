CHAPTER 5

 

Gazetteer of Archaeological Sites

R.F. Sutton, Jr., J. F. Cherry, J. L. Davis, and E. Mantzourani
(with Appendixes by E. Mantzourani and L. Missitzis)

ULL ACCOUNTS OF individual sites and associ-
ated finds are presented below. The following in-
formation is included for each:
Site Number and Name of Site (heading). Although an attempt was made to leam local toponyms
for each site, in many cases this was impossible, and a general name applied to the entire region in
which the site lies, or the name of a nearby location, has been used instead. Georgiou and Faraklas
(1985:214, ill. 1) have published a reliable toponymic map of the island, but place-names of
northwest Keos that are used in this chapter may be found on figure 2.2.

Site Location (line 1). Given as an 8-figure grid reference to the British Army map of the island:
1:50,000 AEGEAN series (Geographical Section, General Staff no. 4468), published by the
British War Office in 1944. (Grid reference is preceded by a K as a designation for the map sheet
for Keos.)

Site Size (line 1). Calculated in hectares, using the length of transects walked (if available) at the
time of initial site collection and corrected, if necessary, by subsequent autopsy (see chap. 2).

Date (line 2). Single periods represented by definitely datable artifacts; parentheses indicate that
fewer than 3 artifacts of a given date were noted. Included are both collected finds and those
recorded but not collected in subsequent revisits to the sites.

Ceramic Summary (line 3). Semiquantitative assessment of total number of dated potsherds and
other ceramic finds from the site. Fragments that join or that obviously belong to the same pot are
counted only once. In a very few cases, it is possible that a piece may belong to more than one
category and, if so, it has been included in each. The number of artifacts possibly of a given date
is in parentheses. Both collected finds and those observed in revisits are considered. A plus sign
(+) indicates the presence of more than the specified number of artifacts.

Lithic Summary (line 4). Number of lithic finds assignable to particular periods.

Background and Data

 

Site Description. Location, current land use, overall visibility, architectural features, and the location of artifacts
of various dates (if concentrations could be recognized).

Presentation of Finds. Pottery, lithics, and other artifacts are described at the end of each site entry (catalog
number, artifact type, illustration, measurements in m, physical description, date, and references). Of the
ceramics, only a representative selection is presented fully; a sample of other sherds has been described
summarily. Unless otherwise indicated, all finds are in the care of the Archaeological Museum of Keos in Chora
(Toulis). In other chapters of this volume, individual artifacts have been referenced by the site and catalog number,
separated by a dash (e.g., 1-1), or, in the case of uncataloged picces, by the site number followed immediately by
an asterisk (¢.g., 1%). Artifacts not found on sites have been assigned to a series of off-site (OS) finds. Individual
drawings in figures 5.1-15 are grouped by type and shape, roughly as they are discussed in chapters 6, 11, and 18.
We realize that this format may occasionally inconvenience the reader who wishes to locate an individual sherd
quickly or to gain an impression of all the finds from a particular site; but we hope that it has the positive
convenience of providing an overview, at a glance, of the range of ceramics of various types and dates represented
within the whole survey area.

Acknowledgments

Many scholars have contributed to the compilation of this catalog. All artifacts were initially described and
assigned preliminary dates in the summer of 1983 by Cherry, Davis, and Mantzourani. The following summer,
material of the historic periods was studied by Robert F. Sutton, Jr., and also examined by Peter J. Callaghan and
John W. Hayes; the prehistoric finds were reviewed by Carol Hershenson and David Wilson. With the
considerable benefit of their expert advice, catalog descriptions were prepared and the periods of occupation at
each site were reconsidered. During the winter of 1984-85, Carolyn Koehler kindly examined drawings and
photographs of several amphorae and helped date them more securely. Alan Johnston generously studied a
drawing and photograph of 71-5. All stone finds have been reviewed by Robin Torrence, who prepared
descriptions for inclusion in this chapter. Coins were initially inspected (uncleaned) in the summer of 1984 and
later taken to Athens for conservation and final identification (see app. 5.1). Comments by Lambros Missitzis on
a photograph of a 17th-century inscription from Site 29 constitute appendix 5.2. The assembling of chapter 5 has
been greatly facilitated by the establishment of a computer file listing all survey finds, their location, date, and
nature; Susan E. Alcock was instrumental in its composition.

A low-density scatter of artifacts on the crest and slopes

of a NW-SE ridge immediately above the main dirt road

from Koressia, approximately 850 m NE of Xyla Bay.

The finds are concentrated around a modem stone caim

and goat shed, to the N and SE of which are preserved

traces of (apparently ancient) walls. Abandoned ter-
races; good visibility. Pottery of the historical periods
was most common in the SE (upslope) parts of the site

and may, in large part, be slope wash from Site 2.

A high-density scatter of artifacts on top of the main
ridge which borders the Xyla streambed on the N; finds
are concentrated on the NW slope of the ridge between
two parallel ridges which run NW to the sea (Site 1 ison
the easternmost of these, approximately 150 m away).
Bare rock outcroppings, some abandoned terraces, and
scattered low bushes; very good visibility. Just beneath
the ridge top on the NW slope, above a modemn wire-
fenced enclosure with metal gates, are the foundations
ofarectangular rower, at least8.5x 11.6m, built of large
undressed blocks (fig. 5.16). Parts of the N, S, and S
walls are preserved (the latter used as the foundation for
amodem field wall). Near the NE comer of the modern
enclosure is a rock-cut cistem with two domed cham-
bers; in one, a pillar of rock was left to support the roof.
‘Traces of waterproof plaster remain on the walls. NE of
the tower foundations, approximately 50m, isamodern
pillarstanding inthe middle of a roughly circularmound
of rubble, perhaps the remains of a collapsed building.
Most obsidian from the site was recovered nearby, on
the ridge top. S of the tower on the edge of the ridge,
overlooking the streambed and bay of Xyla, is a very
small tower (approximately 2 m square), preserved
three storiestoaheight of 2.5 m (fig. 4.3). Each floor has
its own door facing S: the ground and second floorhave
windows, facing W, N, and E, and facing W, respec-
tively. Slabs projecting S provide steps up to the third
floor. All pottery found in the vicinity is perhaps of the
19th century, and the tower is probably a vigla (i.e., a
coastal watchtower), intended to relay news of ap-
proaching pirates.

Scanty traces of antiquities were observed at several
other locations on and around the Perlevos Peninsula:

1. At the NE side of the small headland that closes the
E.end of the small bay immediately E of Glaronisi, a few
pieces of obsidian and pottery (the latter all coarse body

sherds); near the crest of the headland, a sherd with a
diagonally slashed raised band.

2. On the summit of the ridge that forms the Perlevos
Peninsula itself, a collapsed structure with traces of
circular walling, approximately 6 m deep: no associated
poitery.

3. Nearer the bay of Otzias, on top of a rock outcrop-
ping, approximately 450m NE of Site 61,apile of debris
(perhaps a collapsed structure), with no associated
pottery. These remains are to be associated with the
various finds reported by Georgiou and Faraklas (1985:

Very dense scatter of artifacts including a fragment of a

pen and threshing floor at the top of the hill, and
continuing SW to the bottom of the rema.' Abandoned
overgrown terraces with good visibility. SW of the goat
pen, approximately 20m, aretwo very large schist slabs,
possibly belonging to a grave, one apparently covering
a cavity beneath it, the other obviously not in situ.
